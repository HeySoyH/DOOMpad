# DOOMpad
"Yeah sure, notepad is cool and allat, but can it run Doom?" -> YES.
---
Brief instructions:

Download then unzip wherever.
Run "start.bat" to begin playing.
Run "stop.bat" when finish playing (closing the windows manually will not end background processes).

Works on Windows 10.
Keep the small doom window in foreground, otherwise controls won't work.

Do not rename, move, modify or delete any file or folder without knowing.
Some antivirus programs may ask to delete start.bat so just don't let 'em :)
Project is clean, scan it on VirusTotal or check the files' content yourself if u want.

The original project belongs to Samperson, I just made a standalone version including all the missing files that needed to be added manually, plus building an easier way to start and stop the game, and a guide to clarify some important concepts.
