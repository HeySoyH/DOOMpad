# DOOMpad
"Yeah sure, notepad is cool and allat, but can it run Doom?" -> YES.
---
Brief instructions:<br>
<br>
Download then unzip wherever.<br>
Run "start.bat" to begin playing.<br>
Run "stop.bat" when finish playing (closing the windows manually will not end background processes).<br>
<br>
Works on Windows 10.<br>
Keep the small doom window in foreground, otherwise controls won't work.<br>
<br>
Do not rename, move, modify or delete any file or folder without knowing.<br>
Some antivirus programs may ask to delete start.bat so just don't let 'em :)<br>
Project is clean, scan it on VirusTotal or check the files' content yourself if u want.<br>
<br>
The original project belongs to Samperson, I just made a standalone version including all the missing files that needed to be added manually, plus building an easier way to start and stop the game, and a guide to clarify some important concepts.
