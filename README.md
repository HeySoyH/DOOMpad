# DOOMpad
"Yeah sure, notepad is cool and allat, but can it run Doom?" YES.
---
Brief instructions:  <br>

Download the project then unzip wherever.  <br>
Run "start.bat" to begin playing.  <br>
Run "stop.bat" when finish playing (closing the windows manually will not end background processes).  <br>

Works on Windows 10.  <br>
Don't click the notepad window, or keep the small doom window in foreground, otherwise controls won't work.  <br>
Also, it crashes sometimes on start, in case that happens, just restart the game and try again.  <br>

Do not rename, move, modify or delete any file or folder without knowing.  <br>
Some antivirus programs may ask to delete start.bat file, so just don't let 'em.  <br>
Project is clean, scan it on VirusTotal or check the files' content yourself if u want.  <br>

The [original project](https://twitter.com/SamNChiet/status/1579906881887211520) belongs to Samperson (@SamNChiet on Twitter), I just made a standalone version including all the missing files that needed to be added manually, plus building an easier way to start and stop the game, and a guide to clarify some important concepts.  <br>
